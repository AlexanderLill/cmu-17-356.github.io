## Tutorials + Helpful Docs

We'll be learning 3 testing *frameworks* in this section:

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and Jest [Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)
 - [Testing React Apps](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react)
* [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) ~ and you'll see that [*Jest+Enzyme*](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jest.html)
play well together (more in-depth tutorial [here](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-test-react-components-with-jest-and-enzyme-in-depth-145fcd06b90))
 - [Tutorial Videos](https://javascriptplayground.com/testing-react-enzyme-jest/) (the first 5 are free and solid to get up-and-running)
* [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
