# Recitation 7: Typescript

The slides go over some basic use cases of Typescript, and why you may want to
include it in your project.

In this recitation, we integrate Typescript into our existing Todo App codebase, live of course.

For the updated codebase, please pull from our `todo-app` repo! Link is
