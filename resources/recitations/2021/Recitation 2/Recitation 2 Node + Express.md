# Recitation 2: Node + Express

## Goal:

Build a basic backend for our todo-app, and learn about `npm` packages, express endpoints, etc.

## Steps:

1. `mkdir` your project folder (todo-app) and `cd` into it
2. `npm init`
3. `npm install express --save`
4. `npm install body-parser --save`
5. Write express code, as seen in the reference solution
6. `node index.js` (to start the server)
7. (optional) Play with the server, send it post requests
